  abstract = {In recent literature on Gramineae species, leaf and tiller number dynamics have been studied by analysing site filling and the phyllochron of the mainstem. However, site filling is influenced by three components: (1) the phyllochron of the mainstem and daughter tillers; (2) specific site usage (i.e. fraction of buds that ultimately develop into a visible tiller at a specific site); and (3) HS-delay (i.e. difference in Haun Stage (HS) between the parent tiller and daughter tiller above the point where the daughter tiller appears). These three morphological components affecting site filling were studied under different environmental conditions in a growth chamber experiment with spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivumL.). Treatments were temperature (daily average 10.5, 15.5 or 20.5 \{degrees\}C) and light intensity (111, 191 or 286 \{micro\}mol m-2s-1). Effects of temperature and light intensity on phyllochron were well described by equations already reported in the literature. Specific site usage was higher at cooler temperatures and greater light intensities and was related to tiller position. It is proposed that these effects on specific site usage reflect differences in availability of local assimilate for tiller appearance. HS-delay of a tiller was shorter if the expected tiller appearance was later and was only slightly affected by light intensity or temperature. This new concept, combining HS-delay and specific site usage, can be useful in constructing more general models of the effects of environmental factors on the dynamics of leaf number and leaf area ofGramineaespecies.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

  abstract = {Crop simulation models can be used to quantitatively evaluate alternatives ranging from agronomic management issues to climate change, thus the need for precision and accuracy in these types of evaluation. The objective of this study was to improve the simulation of kernels/m2 (KNO), kernel weight (KWT) and grain yield in CERES-Wheat (V 3.0, CW3), while preserving the original structure of the model. The modified model incorporates four changes: (a) KNO was determined as a function of increase in spike weight from the opening of the flag leaf sheath to 50\% anthesis; (b) simulation of kernel set reduction due to high temperature; (c) a new temperature function for simulating kernel fill rate was developed; (d) the amount of stem reserves was reduced by assuming that their accumulation ceases at the beginning of the grain-filling period. The modified model (CWM) was compared against published field data of the cultivars Arapahoe and Karl 92 from 31 sowings conducted over 6 years at Lincoln and Mead, Nebraska. For both cultivars, the root mean square error (RMSE) of simulated KNO went from 4312 kernels/m2 with CW3 to 2608 kernels/m2 with the modified model; RMSE of simulated KWT went from 2.41 mg with CW3 to 2.78 mg with the modified model; and yield RMSE went from 1241 kg ha -1 with the CW3 to 811 kg ha-1 with the modified model. Consideration of reductions in kernel set due to high temperature improved simulated KNO, but was cultivar dependent. CW3 simulated KWT well because KNO was overestimated. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Sirius is a wheat simulation model that calculates biomass production from intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and grain growth from simple partitioning rules. Leaf area index (LAI) is developed from a thermal time sub-model. Phenological development is calculated from the mainstem leaf appearance rate and final leaf number, with the latter determined by responses to daylength and vernalisation. Effects of water and N deficits are calculated through their influences on LAI development and radiation-use efficiency. This paper describes the model and its validation using data from independent and near independent experiments at Lincoln, New Zealand, and Rothamsted, UK. Despite there being no calculation of tiller dynamics or grain number, the model accurately simulated the behaviour of crops exposed to a wide range of conditions. We conclude that the accurate prediction of phenological development and LAI is much more important for grain yield prediction than are the components of yield. Although grain population is not a necessary step in yield calculation in Sirius, the model proved useful in investigating the effects of stress in setting grain number. The analysis showed that the influence of stress on partitioning of biomass to the ear during pre-anthesis ear growth was much more important in determining grain number than was the effect on biomass accumulation during the same phase.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the effect of environment on leaf emergence is necessary for modeling crop canopy growth. This study was to determine the effect of controlled temperature on leaf emergence rate and phyllochron in four winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and four spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes. Nine experiments were conducted in growth chambers at constant temperatures between 7.5 to 25 \{degrees\}C. The number of leaves per culm was recorded daily from seedling emergence until the fourth leaf was mature. At a given temperature, the emergence of new leaves was a linear function of time for all genotypes, with R2 values not less than 0.95. The slopes of the linear regressions, which are the leaf emergence rates (leaves/day), however, differed among genotypes and among temperatures within genotypes. For all genotypes, the leaf emergence rates increased parabolically with increasing temperature until an optimum temperature was reached and then declined. These responses could be described with quadratic polynomials with R2 values greater than 0.96 for all genotypes. As temperature increased, the phyllochron (degree-days/leaf) increased exponentially. The relationships between phyllochron and temperature fit exponential equations with R2 0.97 or greater for all genotypes. The phyllochron ranged among the eight genotypes from 57.2 \{+/-\} 5.2 degree-days at 7.5 \{degrees\}C to 116.2 \{+/-\} 7.1 degree-days at 25 \{degrees\}C. These results suggest that the temperature effect must be considered in modeling phyllochron in wheat and barley.},

  abstract = {Existing models of leaf area expansion of Gramineae species based on individual leaf growth are descriptive and assume that there is no effect of tiller type on individual leaf area. However, sound experimental data on the growth of individual leaves on a plant are lacking. A growth chamber experiment was carried out with young spring wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) plants, and individual leaf area parameters were measured. Treatments were temperature (daily mean 10.5, 15.5 and 20.5 \{degrees\}C) and light intensity (111, 191 and 286 \{micro\}mol m-2s-1). Effects of leaf position and tiller type on maximum leaf width and leaf elongation rate (LER) could be explained by a new assumption, that maximum leaf width, and LER, of a leaf depend on the values for the previous foliar leaf on the same tiller, or on the parent tiller. LER increased linearly with temperature and was not affected by light intensity, whereas maximum leaf width was not influenced by temperature or light intensity. Leaf elongation duration was closely related to phyllochron expressed in days, although this relation was slightly modified by light intensity. Equations formulated for each leaf area parameter accounted for 90\% of the variation in leaf area between different leaf types, temperatures and light intensities. The results give a better general understanding of individual leaf growth of Gramineae species and can be used in the development of more mechanistic models for the simulation of leaf area expansion.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

  abstract = {The Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) is a software framework for creating models that represent the plant components of farm system models in the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM). It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; 1. Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, 2. Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 3. Lucerne, perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 4. Wheat, another detailed annual crop model constructed using an alternative set of organ and process classes. These examples show the PMF can be used to develop models of different complexities and allows flexibility in the approach for implementing crop physiology concepts into model set up.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims A model to predict anthesis time of a wheat plant from environmental and genetic information requires integration of current concepts in physiological and molecular biology. This paper describes the structure of an integrated model and quantifies its response mechanisms.
Methods Literature was reviewed to formulate the components of the model. Detailed re-analysis of physiological observations are utilized from a previous publication by the second two authors. In this approach measurements of leaf number and leaf and primordia appearance of near isogenic lines of spring and winter wheat grown for different durations in different temperature and photoperiod conditions are used to quantify mechanisms and parameters to predict time of anthesis.
Key Results The model predicts the time of anthesis from the length of sequential phases: 1, embryo development; 2, dormant; 3, imbibed/emerging; 4, vegetative; 5, early reproductive; 6, pseudo-stem extension; and 7, ear development. Phase 4 ends with vernalization saturation (VS), Phase 5 with terminal spikelet (TS) and Phase 6 with flag leaf ligule appearance (FL). The durations of Phases 4 and 5 are linked to the expression of Vrn genes and are calculated in relation to change in Haun stage (HS) to account for the effects of temperature per se. Vrn1 must be expressed to sufficient levels for VS to occur. Vrn1 expression occurs at a base rate of 0·08/HS in winter ‘Batten’ and 0·17/HS in spring ‘Batten’ during Phases 1, 3 and 4. Low temperatures promote expression of Vrn1 and accelerate progress toward VS. Our hypothesis is that a repressor, Vrn4, must first be downregulated for this to occur. Rates of Vrn4 downregulation and Vrn1 upregulation have the same exponential response to temperature, but Vrn4 is quickly upregulated again at high temperatures, meaning short exposure to low temperature has no impact on the time of VS. VS occurs when Vrn1 reaches a relative expression of 0·76 and Vrn3 expression begins. However, Vrn2 represses Vrn3 expression so Vrn1 must be further upregulated to repress Vrn2 and enable Vrn3 expression. As a result, the target for Vrn1 to trigger VS was 0·76 in 8-h photoperiods (Pp) and increased at 0·026/HS under 16-h Pp as levels of Vrn2 increased. This provides a mechanism to model short-day vernalization. Vrn3 is expressed in Phase 5 (following VS), and apparent rates of Vrn3 expression increased from 0·15/HS at 8-h Pp to 0·33/HS at 16-h Pp. The final number of leaves is calculated as a function of the HS at which TS occurred (TSHS): 2·86 + 1·1 × TSHS. The duration of Phase 6 is then dependent on the number of leaves left to emerge and how quickly they emerge.
Conclusions The analysis integrates molecular biology and crop physiology concepts into a model framework that links different developmental genes to quantitative predictions of wheat anthesis time in different field situations.},

Absolute and relative growth rates were estimated by regression and by fitting a modified logistic growth function, using thermal time as the independent variable. The number of living florets was counted in spikelet 10. The phyllochron was 101°Cd and 10 florets, at most, were initiated. Floret death started at about ear emergence and was complete in 90°Cd, just before anthesis when there were 4 surviving florets. Successive leaves and internodes grew at approximately 1 phyllochron interval and there were about 1.5 phyllochrons between the growth of leaf 9 and internode 8. The length-growth rate of the internodes increased from 1 mm (°Cd)−1 for internode 6 to 2 mm (°Cd)−1 for internode 9. The relative growth rate was about 0.02 (°Cd)−1 for both leaves and internodes, about twice that of the ear. Dry-mass growth was more complex than length growth and the logistic growth function was not satisfactory for some of the structures. The relation between floret death, stem length and dry-mass growth is consistent with the hypothesis that the death of florets is due to competition between the ear and the stem for resources at the time of the highest growth rate and when translocation may be affected by restriction of the vascular system.},

  abstract = {The area of a fully-grown leaf lamina varied according to its position on the stem, and the temperature, light intensity, and photoperiod under which the plant was grown.In continuous illumination, raising the temperature by 5° intervals between 10 and 25 °C, resulted in progressively higher rates of leaf initiation, emergence, and expansion. The length of the lamina increased with each increase in temperature, but the breadth and thickness decreased. The greatest area of individual leaves was formed at 20 °C. Each increase in light intensity over the range 200, 500, 1000, 1750, and 2500 ft-c resulted in higher rates of leaf initiation, emergence, and expansion, and increases in breadth and thickness, but a decrease in length. The greatest area was formed at 1000–1750 ft-c.An increase in daylength from 8 to 24 hours increased leaf length, breadth, and area. This was a photoperiodic effect, unlike the increase in thickness with increased daylength, which was related to the total light energy received.Chang..., non disponible},

  abstract = {The rate of leaf appearance in wheat depends on temperature. When the rate is expressed in thermal time based on air temperature, a marked contrast is apparent between autumn and spring sowings. This variation has often been attributed to a preconditioning response that determines the thermal phyllochron at about the time of emergence, either directly through an effect of daylength or its rate of change. However, in this paper we show that invoking such a response is unnecessary. Leaf appearance rate was found to be well predicted based only on temperature near the apical meristem (near-surface soil temperature until stem extension began, then canopy temperature) and leaf number. It was not necessary to include a response to daylength or its rate of change. A model of leaf appearance based on estimates of near-surface soil temperature and canopy temperature gave superior predictions than others based on air temperature alone or modified by rate of change of daylength.},

  abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important factors that determine plant growth, development, and yield. Accurate summarization of plant temperature response is thus a prerequisite to successful crop systems modelling and application of such models to management. This paper reports on a general equation that can be used to simulate the temperature response of plants. The equation reads as
r=Rmax(Tmax-TTmax - Topt) (TTopt)ToptTmax - Topt,
where r is the daily rate of growth (or development) at any temperature, Toptis the optimum temperature, Tmaxis the maximum temperature, and Rmaxis the maximum rate of growth or development at Topt. It has the smallest number of parameters possible to simulate the plant response to the full range of temperatures relevant to plant growth and development. The equation was shown to successfully simulate the growth and development of maize, bean, wheat, barley, sorghum, and lambsquarters. The adjusted R -square of fit ranged from 0.747 to 0.998, mostly greater than 0.9. For one maize dataset that contains independent data, the equation was shown to be highly predictive. The equation could find application in crop germplasm classification, crop modelling and environmental control of artificial crop production systems. Copyright 1999 Annals of Botany Company},

  abstract = {A simulation model of the development, growth and yield of the wheat crop is described. It comprises three submodels dealing with water, biomass and phenology. The water submodel determines daily transpiration from which growth is calculated as the product of transpiration and transpiration efficiency. Biomass is allocated to above-ground green and dead biomass, roots and grain. The phenology submodel forms the framework for the allocation of biomass and hence the expression of the accumulation of yield. The model is validated against field data collected on six crops over two successive years in north-west Victoria, Australia. It is generally robust and experimentation with it over a range of seasonal conditions shows that it is realistically sensitive to sowing time through the representations of the physiological processes that form the model. The model should have application to other rainfed areas.},

  abstract = {The allocation dynamics of newly assimilated carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and their responses to management practices in dryland cropping systems are poorly understood. We aim to enhance this knowledge with relevance to identifying management practices that may increase soil organic C (SOC) stocks and N use efficiency. Using in-situ 13CO2 and urea-15N pulse labelling of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at the late heading stage, we investigated allocation of newly assimilated C and N in crop and soil pools as influenced by long-term conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) mixed farming practices. On the first day after labelling, 91–92\% of the added 13C (1.49 g 13CO2-C m−2) and 81–82\% of the soil applied 15N (0.1 g urea-15N m−2) were recovered in the crop and soil pools. Over 50 days (i.e. at grain maturity), only 4–5\% of the 13CO2 was allocated belowground, with 60–64\% of this belowground 13C released via soil respiration, and 72–74\% of the 15N was recovered in the soil to 30-cm depth and only 0.5–0.7\% was allocated aboveground. The long-term differences in tillage practices did not influence allocation of new C (13C) and N (15N) in the wheat crop–soil pools, including aggregate-size fractions. This may be one of the factors in the lack of effect of the contrasting practices on SOC and N stocks, structural stability, microbial biomass, crop N uptake and wheat productivity. The results suggest soil and agronomic functionality in drylands may not be enhanced through conservation tillage management only.},

Experiments were carried out in the field during 1986 and 1987. Biological yield at anthesis was not significantly correlated with year of release. Similarly, no evidence was found of changes in the proportion of photosynthetically active radiation (Qpa) intercepted at anthesis or the efficiency of conversion of intercepted radiation in net dry-matter production pre-anthesis. Biomass partitioning to the spike at anthesis was positively and significantly correlated with year of release of the cultivars. Both spike dry-weight at anthesis and the spike-dry-weight: above-ground-biomass ratio at anthesis were closely associated both with grains per m2 and with harvest index. These last-named characters best explained the changes in grain-yield. Thus, the changes in grain-yield and harvest index achieved by plant breeding could be due to parallel changes in spike dry-weight at anthesis and pre-anthesis biomass partitioning to the spike.},

  abstract = {Increasing duration of stem elongation by exposure to short photoperiod would result in higher spike dry weight at anthesis, which is positively associated with the number of fertile florets and grains in wheat. However, it is not easy to determine whether photoperiod effects on fertile florets and grains are only mediated by assimilate supply to the growing spike when spike weight variation is attained only with photoperiod treatments. The aim of this study was to determine whether photoperiod effects on number of fertile florets and grains may be direct, that is, not mediated by assimilate supply, by comparing the magnitude of photoperiod effects with those of shading the canopy. Spike dry weight at anthesis was changed through the factorial combination of different photoperiod (natural and 6 h extended photoperiod) and shading (un-shaded and 67 ± 3\% shaded) treatments during stem elongation of Buck Manantial, a cultivar known for its photoperiod sensitivity in this phase. Both treatments modified spike dry weight at anthesis and the number of fertile florets and grains, independently. When duration of stem elongation was lengthened by exposure to natural photoperiod and when incident radiation was high, spike dry weight at anthesis increased by 33\% (NP+0 v. NP+6) and 27\% (un-shaded v. shaded), respectively. The number of fertile florets increased similarly to spike dry weight (34\% NP+0 v. NP+6 and 28\% un-shaded v. shaded) resulting in higher number of grains. Most photoperiod effects on the number of fertile florets and, consequently, on the number of grains, were mediated by assimilate supply to the growing spike as the same relationship between the number of fertile florets and spike dry weight at anthesis was observed for photoperiod and shading treatments (R2 = 0.99, P$<$0.05).},
