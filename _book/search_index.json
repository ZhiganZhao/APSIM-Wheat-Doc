Input figures show default parameter values (not genotypic values) or dynamic parameter values (depending on the other status variables) in the APSIM Next Gen model. Output figures show reportable variables in the in the APSIM Next Gen model. The Input and Output variable names only show the last section (separated by full stop) or specified names to save spaces in the figures. Most of figures use two time serial variables, i.e. Stage and Accumulated thermal time since sowing. However, only Stage is used if all values are constant (e.g. Fig. 9.8), or stage based input variables. The key stages are displayed in all figures (Section 3.2) including G for stage 2 Germination, T for stage 4 Terminal Spikelet, F for stage 6 Flowering, E for stage 8 End of Grain Filling. "],
["sec-intro-own-contribution.html", "1.2 How to contribute?", " 1.2 How to contribute? This documentation is wrote by RMarkdown and bookdown. I suggest you firstly to read the introduction about RMarkdown and bookdown, then fork this repository into your github account. Feel free to submit a pull request and/or an issue if you notice any errors or have any comments. A new document can be easily generated for any other simulations using following steps. Install the required software including R, RStudio, Bookdown and other depended packages. Fork or download all source codes from git repository. Replace your own simulation.apsimx under simulation subfolder. Your apsimx file should only have ONE simulation and include all report variables used in the report, which can be found in the report replacement of the existing apsimx file. Click Build All in the RStudio interface. 1.2.1 Retrieve fixed value get_fixed_value function is used to retrieve FixedValue in APSIM Next Gen. The path argument is used to specify the full path to the node with class FixedValue using APSIM format which connects the names of all predecessors started from Wheat. For example, the code below is used to obtain value for GrainsPerGramOfStem with value 22. get_fixed_value(g_pmf, path = &#39;Wheat.Grain.NumberFunction.GrainNumber.GrainsPerGramOfStem&#39;) 1.2.2 Add new figure Figures are classified into Input and Output categories (Section 1.1). div tags in html are used to specify the category. &lt;div class=&quot;fig-input&quot;&gt; ```{r chunk-label, fig.asp=1, fig.cap=&#39;A figure caption.&#39;} # add you codes here ``` &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;fig-output&quot;&gt; ```{r chunk-label, fig.asp=1, fig.cap=&#39;A figure caption.&#39;} # add you codes here ``` &lt;/div&gt; Two variables are exposed to global environment (.GlobalEnv in R), i.e. g_pmf for an xml object of the simulation file _simulation/simulation.apsimx, and g_report for a data.frame of the simulation output file. Variables g_pmf and g_report can be used in any places of the documentation. A few helper functions are designed to plot figures, i.e. plot_xypair and plot_report. plot_xypair is used to plot the XYPairs function in APSIM Next Gen. The path argument is used to specify the full path of a node with child XYPairs using APSIM format which connects the names of all predecessors started from Wheat (e.g. Wheat.Leaf.CohortParameters.MaxArea.AgeFactor). x_lab and y_lab can be used to specify the X and Y labels. path &lt;- &#39;Wheat.Leaf.CohortParameters.MaxArea.AgeFactor&#39; plot_xypair(g_pmf, path, x_lab = &#39;Growthing stage&#39;, y_lab = &#39;Multiplier of maximum leaf area&#39;) plot_report is used to plot outputs of APSIM Next Gen for a single and multiple variables. Two types of X variables are predefined in the global environment (i.e. g_xvar for thermal time and stage; g_xvar2 for stage only). X label is also defined in the global environment. These variables can be overwrote when the plot_report is called, but DO NOT add into global environment as other chunks use the default values. g_xvar &lt;- c(&#39;Wheat.Phenology.Stage&#39;, &#39;Wheat.Phenology.AccumulateThermalTime&#39;) g_xvar2 &lt;- c(&#39;Wheat.Phenology.Stage&#39;) g_xlab &lt;- &#39;Accumulated thermal time or stage&#39; The argument y_cols is used to specify one and multiple variables in the APSIM report using plot_report function.

Each tiller has an apex which continuously developes new leaf. 2.2.3 Leaf Leaf organ is only included leaf blades excluding section under sheath, i.e. only parts of leaf blades to produce photosynthate. Huan Index is mainly concerned with the leaf production stage of development (Haun 1973). The length of each emerging leaf is expressed as a fraction of the length of the preceding fully emerged leaf.

["cha-structure.html", "Chapter 4 Structure", " Chapter 4 Structure The development of wheat leaves and tillers are simulated with an apex model which is further developed from leaf cohort model (Brown et al. 2014). The basic assumptions include The growth and development of a plant is controlled by apex. Only one apex is existed in a plant at emergence. Branching increases the total apex number of a plant. Apex death decreases the apex number, which are caused by several reasons including the carbon allocation, light intensity, natural death. The apex number is not necessary as an integer to simulate plant development in the population level. The number of apex in a plant determines the number of the new leaves when initialization of a new cohort. The cohort size is fixed after initialization although attributes can be changed in the later stage. The apexes are grouped by age and have the same age if they initialize at the same day. During development of new cohort, new apexes caused by branching develops into new tillers which have the same behaviours during the whole lift span (e.g. size, area, nitrogen, photosynthesis). The apex age equals to 1 when it initialize and increases by 1 when a new leaf cohort initializes. Each apex group has several attributes including size and age. The leaves in a cohort also are distinguished and grouped by apex ages, which determines at the initialization of leaf cohort. Death of branches or tillers only reduces the total number of apexes, not the size of existing cohorts. The apexes with youngest age are going to death first. "],
["sec-str-phyllochron.html", "4.1 Phyllochron", " 4.1 Phyllochron The phyllochron is the intervening period between the sequential emergence of leaf tips on the main stem of a wheat (McMaster and Hunt 2003). The non-linear reponse of temperature on phyllchron were observed by Friend et al. (1962) and Cao and Moss (1989). The soil temperature provided more accurately prediction of leaf development than air temperature (Jamieson et al. 1995). However, a simple linear reponse of phyllochron to air temperature works surprusingly well in predicting phyllochron for most field conditions (McMaster and Hunt 2003). If improvements are desired, the use of non-linear reponses and soil temperature shows promise (Jamieson et al. 1995; Yan and Hunt 1999). Consequently, we assume the linear reponse of air temperature on leaf appearance (phyllochorn). The base phyllochron is a genotypic parameter with default value 120, but is chagned for most of cultivars. Based on (Jamieson et al. 1995), leaf appearance could be described by a base phyllochron determined between leaves 3 and 7 and a phyllochron that was 70% of base phyllochron for leaves &lt; 3 and 140% of base phyllochroen for leaves &gt; 7 (Fig. 4.1). The phyllochron also is adjusted by photoperiod [reference required] through increasing pholochron in the shorter day length (Fig. 4.2). Figure 4.1: Phyllochron of leaf cohort is depending on the rank on the main stem Figure 4.2: The multiplier of phyllochron which is effected by daily photoperiod length. Finally, the phyllochron is dynamically adjusted according to appeared cohort number and daily photoperiod (Fig. 4.3). Figure 4.3: The actual phyllochron in the testing environment "],

After Emergence, the potential appearance of tip number in the main stem (\\(N_{p, tip}\\)) is daily increased according to the daily phyllochron (Fig. 4.3) and thermal time (Section 3.1) until Maturity (Fig. 4.5 and 4.6. \\(N_{p, tip}\\) should stop increasing when final leaf number is reached). \\[ \\Delta N_{p, tip} = \\frac{\\Delta TT_{t}}{P_{phy}} \\] where, \\(N_{p, tip}\\) is the daily increase of leaf tip number (Fig. 4.5), \\(\\Delta TT_{t}\\) is the daily thermal time, \\(P_{phy}\\) is the phyllochron calculated at today.

In the Structure model, the tip numbers are not calculated for branches or tillers, but only for main stem (Figure 4.6). Before plant reaches the final leaf number (i.e. all leaves are initialized and appeared), a new leaf cohort is initialized and appeared when increases of \\(N_{p, tip}\\) are more than 1 (Figure 4.5). Consequently, the rates of leaf initialization and appearance are same, except initialized tip number is more than 2 of appeared tip number. Figure 4.6: Tips number in main stem.

From stage Emergence to Terminal Spikelet (Section 3.2), the potential branching rate is defined as a function of number of appeared cohorts in the main stem (Figure 4.10) which follow the pattern of Fibonacci sequence. Beyond this period, the branching rate is set as zero. Figure 4.10: Potential branching rate of APSIM-Wheat as a function of appreared cohort number Two stresses are defined in the APSIM-Wheat including nitrogen and WSC. A simple sensitivity analysis indicates the branching rate is too sensitive to WSC with default values (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). So, this feature is disabled for further analysis. The nitrogen stress is calculated as a function of fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand which is exported from the Arbitrator module. Wheat module assumes no nitrogen stress when the nitrogen supply is bigger than 1.5 times of nitrogen demand (Figure 4.11). Nitrogen stress linearly increases when supply/demand ratio less then 1.5 (Reference required.)

["cha-biomass.html", "Chapter 5 Biomass", " Chapter 5 Biomass Wheat plants are separated into 5 organs, (i.e. Grain, Root, Leaf, Spike, Stem). Leaf includes only leaf blades (Chapter 10). Stem is defined in a functional rather than a morphological manner and includes nodes, internodes and leaf sheaths (Chapter 12). Spike is the head parts without grain including pedicel and glunes (Chapter 11). Grain is the grain part of heads (Chapter 8). Root is the whole root system below ground (Chapter 9). The biomass supply comes from three sources (Fixation (Photosynthesis), Retranslocation, Reallocation, Section 5.1). In theory, all organs can provide Fixation through photosynthesis, but only Leaf is considered in the current wheat model. Fixation The wheat model in the APSIM next generation uses the gross photosynthesis rate, not the net photosynthesis rate in the old APSIM. Retranslocation Reallocation The biomass and nitrogen of each organ is separated into two pools (i.e. Live and Dead, Section 5.5). Each pool is separated into three components (i.e. Structural, Metabolic, Storage, (Section 5.2) ) (Brown et al. 2014). Structural biomass are essential for the growth of the organ. They remain within the organ once it has been allocated and are passed from Live to Dead pools as the organ senescence. Metabolic biomass are essential for growth and their concentration can influence the function of organs (e.g. photosynthetic efficiency of the leaf depends on Metabolic nitrogen content). Metabolic biomass may be reallocated (moved to another organ upon senescence of this organ) or retranslocated (moved to another organ at any time when supplies do not meet the structural and metabolic biomass demands of growing organs). Storage biomass are non-essential to the function of an organ. They will be allocated to an organ only when all other organs have received their Structural and Metabolic allocations and may be reallocated or retranslocated. Daily biomass supply (Section 5.1) is comsumed by growth respiration (Section 5.3.1) , then partitioned into structural and metabolic components in the Live organs (Fig. 5.9) according to the relative demand of each organ (Section 5.2). The remaining biomass is partitioned into storage (i.e. Stem (Chapter 12) and Spike (Chapter 11) , Fig. 5.12). Meanwhile, the metabolic and storage biomass are comsumed by maintenance respiration (Section 5.3.2) . "],

["sec-respiration.html", "5.3 Respiration", " 5.3 Respiration As the major roles of carbon balance of crop, respiration is separated into two components, i.e. growth and maintenance respiration (van Iersel and Seymour 2000; Chiariello, Mooney, and Williams 2000). van Iersel and Seymour (2000) described “growth respiration is referred as the amount of carbohydrates respired in a net gain in plant biomass. This includes the production of ATP and reductant for biosynthetic processes, transport processes, and nutrient uptake and reduction. Maintenance respiration is defined as the respiration needed to provide the energy for all plant processes that do not result in a net increase in plant dry matter, such as maintenance of ion gradients across membranes and the resynthesis of degraded organic compounds”. Figure 5.13: The growth and maintenance respirations. 5.3.1 Growth respiration (Conversion efficiency)) The allocated biomass of an organ losses through growth respiration (i.e, 1 - Conversion efficiency). The growth respiration is applied to all components of an organ (i.e. structural, metabolic, storage). Table 5.5: Biomass conversion efficiency for all organs.

The metabolic and storage components of Live pool is daily reduced according to a fraction which is used for maintenance respiration (Fig. 5.16). The maintenance fraction is calculated as reference maintenance fraction at 20 C and a beta function (Wang and Engel 1998) with three cardinal temperatures (i.e. minimum, optimal and maximum temperatures). All organs have the same cardinal temperatures, but different maintenance fraction at 20C (Table 5.6). Finally, the actual maintenance fraction depends on the daily mean temperature (Fig. 5.16. Leaf and Stem have the major contributions to maintenance respiration (Fig. 5.17). Root and Grain don’t have maintenance respiration (Fig. 5.17).

The length of each period depends on the phylochron during Appearance from Initialized to Appeared (fixed by 2 initial leaves at Germination). Other periods are configured by CohortParameters at Appearance, so that parameter values are determined by the values of status variables at the day of leaf cohort Appearance if they depend on other variables. Several status variables are defined for each leaf cohort, which can be used in other modules to describe the current status of leaf cohort, i.e. IsNotAppeared, IsGrowing, IsAlive, IsGreen, IsNotSenescing, Senescing, isFullyExpanded, ShouldBeDead, IsAppeared and IsInitialised. Figure 10.1: The life cycle of a leaf cohort. 10.1.1 leaf age The age of leaf cohort is defined as the thermal time after appearance, (i.e. keep zero after initialization). As the default values of DetachmentLagDuration and DetachmentDuration are set as 1000000 °Cd, the cohort age keeps increasing until growth stage ReadyForHarvesting. The age of first leaf cohort starts from 200 °Cd. 10.1.2 Leaf initialization and appearance At Germination, 2 new leaf cohorts are initialized with initial leaf area 200, 0 mm2. The inital leaf area simulates seed biomass or embryo size. At Emergence stage, 1 leaf cohort is appeared at the main stem, and 1 new leaf cohort is initialized. After Emergence and before plant reaches the final leaf number (i.e. all leaves are initialized and appeared), a new leaf cohort initialises and an existing leaf cohot appears when increases of potential appearance of tip number are more than 1 (Figure 4.5). Consequently, the rates of leaf initialization and appearance are same, except initialized tip number is more than 2 of appeared tip number (Fig. 10.2).

The growth duration of spring wheat is close to one phylochron as the synchronization of leaf blade and sheath (Skinner and Nelson 1995). The growth duration is set as 1.3 phyllochron in default. The growth duration is adjusted for fraction of flag leaf (Fig. 4.8) to simulate the variation of final leaf number in a population. Lag duration Lag duration (full functional duration) is defined as 4 phyllochrons for leaf appeared during vegetative period (from Emergence to TerminalSpikelet) and adjusted by leaf age. For leaf cohort appeared during stem elongation period (from TerminalSpikelet to FlagLeaf), the lag duration equals to total length from stage FlagLeaf to stage EndGrainFill minus 3 phyllochron (senescence duration), i.e. flag leaf is completely death at the stage EndGrainFill. Senescene duration Senescence duration is defined as 3 phyllochrons in default. As the variation of phyllochron (Fig. 4.3), the growth, lag and senescence durations also change by cohort rank (Fig. 10.3).

["sec-spike-biomass.html", "11.1 Biomass", " 11.1 Biomass 11.1.1 Supply In Spike, the biomass supply only sources from retranslocation (Fig. 11.2). Daily retranslocation is the proportion of current storage (\\(B_{spike, storage}\\)) from StartGrainFill to EndGrainFill with default value 0.5, i.e. daily retranslocatable biomass is 50% of total storage during grain filling (Fig. 11.1). Figure 11.1: Growth duration of spike development Figure 11.2: Biomass supply from spike 11.1.2 Demand The biomass demand is calculated as the total demands of two components (i.e. structural \\(BD_{spike,\\,structural}\\) and storage \\(BD_{spike,\\,storage}\\)) as no metabolic demand is considered in the wheat model. The structural fraction \\(F_{spike, structure}\\) is defined as the fraction of structural component as total biomass (0.9), i.e. \\(1-F_{spike, structure}\\) is the fraction of storage biomass. The spike demand depends on the the potential weight of a spike (\\(B_{max, spike}\\)) and head number (\\(N_{head}\\)) during spike growth period. In theory, \\(B_{max, spike}\\) contains the structural and metabolic components (0.5 g per spike in default value). However, no metabolic component is considered in spike. The potential weight of a spike is 0.45 g per spike and 320 g m-2 in the population only for structural component. Structural demand of Spike (\\(BD_{spike, structural}\\)) is determined by the population based demand function since Stage 5 (FlagLeaf) to Stage 7 (StartGrainFill). The structural demand includes the growth respiration (Section 5.3.1). \\[ BD_{spike, structural} = \\Delta TT \\times N_{head} \\frac {B_{max, spike}}{T_{growth}} \\times F_{spike, structure} / C_{spike, efficiency} \\] where \\(\\Delta TT\\) is the daily thermal time in the phenology module (Fig. 2.2); \\(N_{head}\\) is the head number per unit area ( # m-2 ground), i.e. total stem population at flowering time (Fig. 4.18); \\(W_{max, spike}\\) is the potential weight of spike (0.5 g per spike). \\(T_{growth}\\) is the growth duration of spike (\\(TT\\), the thermal time target from FlagLeaf to StartGrainFill). As the target of EarlyReproductive is sensitive to photoperiod (Section 3.2), the growth duration can be changed during spike development depending on the photoperiod (Fig. 11.4). Consequently, the potential growth rate is 1 g m-2 ground °Cd-2. \\(F_{spike, structure}\\) is the structural fraction of Spike with default value 0.9. \\(C_{spike,efficiency}\\) is the conversion efficiency of Spike, i.e. the efficiency of allocation biomass converted into carbon (growth respiration). \\(C_{efficiency}\\) has the default value 0.7067 and is counted before allocation. Figure 11.3: Head, live stem and total population in unit area. The head number is determined at flag leaf stage as the total stem population. Figure 11.4: Growth duration of spike development Storage demand (\\(BD_{spike,\\,storage}\\)) is to fill the non-structural components (i.e. storage for Spike) as the difference of theoretical maximum and base allocated biomass, and then divides growth respiration (Section 5.3.1). \\[ BD_{spike,\\,storage} = [\\frac{B_{spike,\\,structural} + BD_{spike,\\,structural}}{F_{spike, structure}} - (B_{spike} + BD_{spike,\\,structural})] / C_{spike, efficiency} \\] The theoretical maximum biomass equals to current spike structural weight (\\(B_{spike,\\,structural}\\)) plus structural demand (\\(BD_{spike,\\,structural}\\)), then divide the structural fraction (\\(F_{spike, structure}\\)). The base allocated biomass equals to current spike weight (\\(B_{spike}\\)) plus structural demand (\\(BD_{spike,\\,structural}\\)). Consequently, the spike grows from FlagLeaf to StartGrainFill, and can store more biomass until maturity (Fig. 11.5).
