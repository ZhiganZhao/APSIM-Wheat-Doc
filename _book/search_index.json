Main stem The first culm that emerges from the seeds is the main stem. Tiller (Branch) All remaining culms that emerges from main stem or other tillers (branches), are referred as tillers or branches. Apex A shoot apex is the terminal bud of plants that grows from 0.1-1.0 mm and consists of the apical meristem, developing leaves and the immediate surrounding leaf primordial. Each tiller has an apex which continuously developes new leaf. 2.2.3 Leaf Leaf organ is only included leaf blades excluding section under sheath, i.e. only parts of leaf blades to produce photosynthate. Huan Index is mainly concerned with the leaf production stage of development (Haun 1973). The length of each emerging leaf is expressed as a fraction of the length of the preceding fully emerged leaf.

["cha-structure.html", "Chapter 4 Structure", " Chapter 4 Structure The development of wheat leaves and tillers are simulated with an apex model which is further developed from leaf cohort model (Brown et al. 2014). The basic assumptions include The growth and development of a plant is controlled by apex. Only one apex is existed in a plant at emergence. Branching increases the total apex number of a plant. Apex death decreases the apex number, which are caused by several reasons including the carbon allocation, light intensity, natural death. The apex number is not necessary as an integer to simulate plant development in the population level. The number of apex in a plant determines the number of the new leaves when initialization of a new cohort. The cohort size is fixed after initialization although attributes can be changed in the later stage. The apexes are grouped by age and have the same age if they initialize at the same day. During development of new cohort, new apexes caused by branching develops into new tillers which have the same behaviours during the whole lift span (e.g. size, area, nitrogen, photosynthesis). The apex age equals to 1 when it initialize and increases by 1 when a new leaf cohort initializes. Each apex group has several attributes including size and age. The leaves in a cohort also are distinguished and grouped by apex ages, which determines at the initialization of leaf cohort. Death of branches or tillers only reduces the total number of apexes, not the size of existing cohorts. The apexes with youngest age are going to death first. "],
["sec-str-phyllochron.html", "4.1 Phyllochron", " 4.1 Phyllochron The phyllochron is the intervening period between the sequential emergence of leaf tips on the main stem of a wheat (McMaster and Hunt 2003). The non-linear reponse of temperature on phyllchron were observed by Friend et al. (1962) and Cao and Moss (1989). The soil temperature provided more accurately prediction of leaf development than air temperature (Jamieson et al. 1995). However, a simple linear reponse of phyllochron to air temperature works surprusingly well in predicting phyllochron for most field conditions (McMaster and Hunt 2003). If improvements are desired, the use of non-linear reponses and soil temperature shows promise (Jamieson et al. 1995; Yan and Hunt 1999). Consequently, we assume the linear reponse of air temperature on leaf appearance (phyllochorn). The base phyllochron is a genotypic parameter with default value 120, but is chagned by most of cultivars. Based on (Jamieson et al. 1995), leaf appearance could be described by a base phyllochron determined between leaves 3 and 7 and a phyllochron that was 70% of base phyllochron for leaves &lt; 3 and 140% of base phyllochroen for leaves &gt; 7 (Fig. 4.1). The phyllochron also is adjusted by photoperiod [reference required] through increasing pholochron in the shorter day length (Fig. 4.2). Figure 4.1: Phyllochron of leaf cohort is depending on the rank on the main stem Figure 4.2: The multiplier of phyllochron which is effected by daily photoperiod length. Finally, the phyllochron is dynamically adjusted according to appeared cohort number and daily photoperiod (Fig. 4.3). Figure 4.3: The actual phyllochron in the testing environment "],

They remain within the organ once it has been allocated and are passed from Live to Dead pools as the organ senesces. Metabolic biomass and N are essential for growth and their concentration can influence the function of organs (e.g. photosynthetic efficiency of the leaf depends on Metabolic nitrogen content). Metabolic biomass and nitrogen may be reallocated (moved to another organ upon senescence of this organ) or retranslocated (moved to another organ at any time when supplies do not meet the structural and metabolic biomass demands of growing organs).

Other periods are configured by CohortParameters at Appearance, so that parameter values are determined by the values of status variables at the day of leaf cohort Appearance if they depend on other variables. Several status variables are defined for each leaf cohort, which can be used in other modules to describe the current status of leaf cohort, i.e. IsNotAppeared, IsGrowing, IsAlive, IsGreen, IsNotSenescing, Senescing, isFullyExpanded, ShouldBeDead, IsAppeared and IsInitialised. Figure 8.1: The life cycle of a leaf cohort. 8.1.1 leaf age The age of leaf cohort is defined as the thermal time after appearance, (i.e. keep zero after initialization).

After Emergence and before plant reaches the final leaf number (i.e. all leaves are initialized and appeared), a new leaf cohort initialises and an existing leaf cohot appears when increases of potential appearance of tip number are more than 1 (Figure 4.4).

The growth duration of spring wheat is close to one phylochron as the synchronization of leaf blade and sheath (Skinner and Nelson 1995). The growth duration is set as 1.3 phyllochron in default. Lag duration Lag duration (full functional duration) is defined as 4 phyllochrons for leaf appeared during vegetative period (from Emergence to TerminalSpikelet) and adjusted by leaf age. For leaf cohort appeared during stem elongation period (from TerminalSpikelet to FlagLeaf), the lag duration equals to total length from stage FlagLeaf to stage EndGrainFill minus 3 phyllochron (senescence duration), i.e. flag leaf is completely death at the stage EndGrainFill. Senescene duration Senescence duration is defined as 3 phyllochrons in default. As the variation of phyllochron (Fig. 4.3), the growth, lag and senescence durations also change by cohort rank (Fig. 8.3).

As the target of EarlyReproductive is sensitive to photoperiod (Section 3.2), the growth duration can be changed during spike development depending on the photoperiod (Fig. 9.3). The head number, growth duration and potential spike weight are defined as potential spike weight including the structural and storage conponents and the growth respiration. \\(F_{spike, structure}\\) is the structura fraction of Spike with default value 0.9 (Fig. 9.4). \\(C_{spike,efficiency}\\) is the conversion efficiency of Spike, i.e. the efficiency of alloction biomass converted into structural carbon (growth respiration). \\(C_{efficiency}\\) has the default value 0.7067 (Fig. @(fig:spike-stucture-fraction)). Figure 9.3: Growth duration of spike development Figure 9.4: Growth duration of spike development Figure 9.5: Conversion efficiency of spike Storage demand is to fill the non-structural components (i.e. storage for Spike). Current structural biomass and structural demand are used to calculate the potential total biomass of Spike (structural plus storage). The difference of potental total biomas and current biomass are the storage demand. Storage demand also include the growth respiration. \\[ D_{spike, storage} = \\frac {(W_{spike, structural} + D_{spike, structural}) / F_{spike, structure} - W_{spike, structural} + W_{spike, storage} + D_{spike, structural}} {C_{spike, efficiency}} \\] No metabolic demand is calculated for Spike.
